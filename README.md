# RobotHandV2
This has most of the files relating to the code, and mechanics of the robot hand and arm band.

If you have any more detailed questions, reach out to me on instagram or email at basementbuilds48@gmail.com

This should be taken as resource for different ideas, not as a tutorial to copy exactly.
The main code is run on the esp32 on the robot hand. There is also code for the glove, and the arm band, which send messages to the main robot on how to move.

If you try to use this code for some reason, make sure anytime 2 esps need to communicate wirelessly, they have the correct mac address in the code.

Neural network:
I also included some python code and training data related to the neural network I tried making.
I also included a paper explaining the neural network that I made for a class project.
